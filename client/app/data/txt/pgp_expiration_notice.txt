Esteemed %ReceiverName%,

This is an e-mail notification to notify you that your PGP key is expired on %PGPExpirationDate%

Without a valid PGP key, the system won't be able to send you encrypted notifications.

You are invited to extend its validity and reload it on the platform or to upload a new key.

Take Care,
