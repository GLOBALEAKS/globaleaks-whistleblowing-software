## Development hardcore option

**Option --XXX permits to specify some options that broke GLBackend security and reliability **

Usage:

    --XXX number_position_one,string_position_two,string_position_three


  * number_position_one: the number of seconds added every time the current data is checked, this can emulate GLBackend run in the future of the specified seconds
  * string_position_two: if this string is enabled, every UUIDv4 is generated not by random sources but with YOURSTRING-XXX-XXX-[sameformat]-NNN where NNN is an incremental number. It's considered if something longer that two bytes is present
  * string_position_three if something longer than 1 byte is present, enable mlockall


## Monitoring GLBackend behavior 

watch -d bin/globaleaksadmin safexport workingdir/db/glbackend-12.db print 

## using ramdisk with unit test

    mount -t tmpfs -o size=10M tmpfs ./testing_dir/
