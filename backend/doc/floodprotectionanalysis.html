    </div>
</div>

<div id="introduction" class="paragraph">
    <p><b>GlobaLeaks</b>: is an application written in Python that listed on a Tor Hidden service, by default and in every possible setup, is exposed via Darknet in order to anonymize every traffic received. GlobaLeaks can be used by a newspapers, an human right monitor organisation or what so ever, in order to never undcerestimate the data retention security, the Darknet is the basement of the application. The side effect, is that every blacklist based approach used in anti-resource exhaustion reserched on the IP-based-Internet cannot works.</p>

<p>
GlobaLeaks is an application with various features prone to be DoSsed by attackers; The Application has three kind of user/role: Administrator (owner of the node, manager of everything), Receivers (persons who receive submissions encrypted for them), Whistleblower (an anonymous user that submit document). This cause that the node, always will be prone to resource exhaustion attacks, for the very nature of the anonymous whistleblowing, always has to be open to
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Submission</b>: is the procedure that permits to an anonymous user (hopefully, a whistleblower) to create an entry in the database, and trigger some notification and other CPU intensive operation like cryptography with public key for the recipients. <span class="techdets">Write actively on the database, and trigger notification for receivers</span>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Comment</b>: is a text added by an anonymous user (the potential whistleblower that has performed the submission), authenticated in a previously created submission. <span class="techdets">Write actively on the database</span>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>File upload</b>: is the operation, potentially Disk exhausting, performed by an anonymous user. this may happen during the submission or the in subsequent comment phases. <span class="techdets">Write actively on the database and on the disk, if end to end encryption is enabled or not, the disk impact can be higher (no end2end means that every file get encrypted for the PGP key of receivers, keeping one copy per receiver, multiplying the disk space required per file)</span>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Login</b>: is the operation, potentially locking database, bruteforcing password, can be performed by an anonymous user (using the receipt obtained at the end of every submission, or looking for previously existing receipts).
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Current status</h3>

<div class="paragraph">
  <p>Anti flood protection has been introduced in the stable version of GlobaLeaks in Q1 2015, now in Q3 2015 we are performing some stress test, to measure the effectiveness of the adopted solutions.</p>
  <p></p>
</div>


<div class="smallinfo">Follow the description of the technologies planned, and their current status of implementation </div>

<h4>Graphical Captcha</h4>
<pre>
Graphical Captcha are to be shown to the whistleblower when the system is under attack.
When a whistleblower is making a new submission, and he want to finalize it, it will be asked to insert an appropriate Captcha to confirm the action

</div>

<h4>Human Captcha</h4>
<pre>
Human Captcha are to be shown to the whistleblower when the system is under attack.
When a whistleblower is making a new submission, and he want to finalize it, it will be asked to insert mathematical computation in order to demonstrate that the whistleblower is a human.
</pre>
<div class="detail"><span class="status">Status of the implementation:</span>
</div>


<h4>Delay over New Submission</h4>
<pre>
When the system detects that there is an attack going on, it adds a delay on the submission finalization API in order to slow down the attack. If the system is under attack, the GLClient is notified that the system is under attack, and the user is warned that he will need to wait for X seconds (es: 60-90s) 
</pre>
<div class="detail"><span class="status">Status of the implementation:</span>
</div>

<h4>Rate limit on Tip operations</h4>
<pre>
The operations done by the Whistleblower over a single Tip are few and the interaction are highly delayed in the normal operation.  By applying a Rate Limiting on the amount of actions that a Whistleblower can operate over a Tip within a given time period, it’s possible to prevent the attacks based on thousands of file uploading and comments posting actions.
</pre>
<div class="detail"><span class="status">Status of the implementation:</span>
</div>

<h4>Per recipient notification limits</h4>
<pre>
The effect of a submission flood is badly perceived by the receiving Journos because of the tons of email received.  We can collect statistics on the notification sent on recipient basis and just avoid sending more than Y new notification if there are more than X/time on a certain defined period. 
</pre>
<div class="detail"><span class="status">Status of the implementation:</span>
</div>

<h4>Make it easier to delete multiple Tips</h4>
<pre>
Once a flood will enter into the system, the Tip List shown to the receiver will become dirty and difficult to be used. By enabling the receivers to select a set of Tips and to mark them for deletion will enable the Receiver to self-clean the fake-tips. 
</pre>
<div class="detail"><span class="status">Status of the implementation:</span>
</div>

<h4>Proof of Work Antispam with <a href="http://www.uri.edu/webservices/howTo/hashCash.html">HashCash</a>
</h4>
<pre>
Another parallel approach to minimize the use of automated SpamBot is to move part of computation power on the client-side by using HashCash. That way each client submitting an interaction will have to compute a certain amount of work with their CPU, introducing a slow delay between each action.
</pre>
<div class="detail"><span class="status">Status of the implementation:</span>
</div>

<h4>Caching of Public API</h4>
<pre>
If the attackers want to exhaust the computational resources of the node by parallely making tons of request to public APIs, triggering CPU computation, DB I/O and RAM use, we may use this prevention feature to reduce the impact of attack.
</pre>
<div class="detail"><span class="status">Status of the implementation:</span>

<h4>Auditing and alerting of Flood
</h4>

The flood detection and protection system must properly log every event of flood detection and alert the admin

<h1>Timing execution stats</h1>
<h3>In order to investigated on the queue developed under stress testing, a modified version of GlobaLeaks has been used. The patch export via CSV some timings stats.</h3>

<p>Follow an example of 80 submission started in nearly the same time, using the stress testing script mocha_stress.js</p>
<p>Is executed for two times, and you see in the "x" the incremental number of the request, and in the "y" line the milliseconds of duration.</p>

<p>Here instead also the token is present, it display the fact that Token is a CPU-less intensive operation, answered indipendentely from the Database load. The queue display that more submission are in queue, and more time they require to get processed once per time.</p>

        The delivery schedule was processing the removal of the tip in a single transact, and this would take a lots of time to be completed. during the stress test, the database is resulted corrupted when globaLeaks has been stopped forcefully during such delete operation.
        Permit a robust deletion of the Tip is essential to free a node that get flooded. Now the operation has been done atomic, and also large removal can be approached., and also large removal can be approached.

    <p>Generally speaking, having one subtask that may last for less than one seconds or for hours became troublesome when potentially the attacker can forcefully bring your system in this condition.</p>

        In the cases above, we have no visibility on the reasons of this blocking, if the queue is grown up during the iteration, or the percentage of work executed so far. In such condition, is impossible having an answer from any HTTP handlers (admin authentication, new submissions)

    <p><b>Scheduled operation are an essential part in the anti-DoS scenario:</b> all the activities resource intensive has to be done in these scheduled event, so the resource usage do not depend directly from user interation. If you left an anonymous user send you applicative command that trigger email, disk encryption or other tasks, you are prone to Applicative Denial of Service.</p>

    <h4>Memory usage</h4>
    <p>Lefting a stress tester that perform 30~40 submission every 30 seconds, without triggering the anomaly (because at the moment is capped as 50 in 30secs), bring the test boxes (Intel i7 with 8gb of Ram) to fill 95% of memory and 600 Mb of swap. The output of <b>pmap</b> below is heavily reduced for space reasons, only the entry using more memory has been kept.</p>

    <p>After the Notification schedule, any operation in the DB get denied because is a non-atomic operation, and deny all the DB operation (read only, too). Forcing cleaning operation when the DB is blocked, cause the irrecuperable condition of:</p>
    <pre>
DatabaseError: database disk image is malformed
    </pre>
</div>

<h3>Solution</h3>
<div>
  in mailflush_sched.py, line 195:

<pre>
storedevnts = store.find(EventLogs, EventLogs.mail_sent == False)
storedevnts.order_by(Asc(EventLogs.creation_date))
</pre>

    Now that section of code has been changed with a query limitation (event_number has a default value of 30, considering that many messages are optiizely don't sent, then we
    pick the first 90th event.) This is enough to avoid the load of the operation block the backend.
<pre>
@transact_ro
def load_complete_events(store, event_number=GLSettings.notification_limit):
    """
    event_number represent the amount of event that can be returned by the function,
    events to be notified are taken in account later.
    """
    event_list = []
    storedevnts = store.find(EventLogs, EventLogs.mail_sent == False)[:event_number * 3]
</pre>

</div>

<p>This approach has solved the deadlock.</p>
