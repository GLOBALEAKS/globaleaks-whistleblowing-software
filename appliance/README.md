# GlobaLeaks Appliance Scripts

The aim of this folder is to keep track of a plethora of GlobaLeaks Applicance
solutions.

The solutions currently taken into consideration are the following:

* [Packer](https://github.com/globaleaks/GLAppliance/tree/master/Packer)
* [Vagrant](https://github.com/globaleaks/GLAppliance/tree/master/Vagrant)
* [Docker](https://github.com/globaleaks/GLAppliance/tree/master/Docker)

Basically thanks to the above solution it would be possible to:

* Easily instantiate GlobaLeaks Demos;
* Perform Manual and Automatic Unit Testing;
* Easily instatiate a Full Fladged GlobaLeaks Appliance.


## GlobaLeaks Packer Script

[Packer](http://www.packer.io/) is a tool for building identical machine images
for multiple platforms from a single source configuration.

This can be used for example in order to:

* automatically build GlobaLeaks VirtualBox images;
* automatically build Globaleaks VMware Images;
* and deploy GlobaLeaks even on Cloud Services (AMIs EC2, ..)!
